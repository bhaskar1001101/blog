<p>computer science is a terrible name for this business. first of all, its not a science -- it might be engineering or it might be art. or we'll see that computer so-called science actually has a lot in common with magic. so its not a science. and its not really very much about computers. and its not really about computers in the same sense that physics is not really about particle accelerators and biology is not about microscopes and petri dishes. its not about computers in the same sense that geometry is not about using surveying instruments. in fact, there is a lot of commonality between computer science and geometry. geometry, first of all is another subject with a lousy name. the name comes from gaia - meaning the earth and metron - meaning to measure.</p>

<h2>what is a computer?</h2>
<p>the wikipedia page on computer calls it a lot of things. but a quick encyclopedia is seldom the source of all knowledge. computers dont really have anything to do with what we call a computer in day to day life.</p>
<p>the word computer is an amalgamation of "com" + "putare". two latin words that mean "together" and "to think" respectively. together, they mean "collective thinking". or so it could mean. to think about the collective meaning of a word requires communication between the thinkers. somewhere along the collective lossy information transfer, we thought "computare" meant "to calculate/ to sum up/ to count" ( in latin ). somewhere along the infinite game of human whispers, we thought "computer" meant "a person who calculates".</p>
<p>why should we care about an etymological perspective to anything? what purpose does etymology serve us? whether we think with words, or without words (just feel things), episteme (knowledge) is deeply in love with logos (the word of god/divinity ). episteme yearns for the etymon (the true meaning) of logos. this act of yearning is termed as etymology. thus, we think together, computer to computer, about what a computer is.</p>
<p>in the act of coming to a shared understanding of what a computer is, ( an automatic mechanistic device that can be programmed to perform logical operations ), somewhere along the curve, we may be losing the ability to listen to the words of god. i hope, that i am wrong about this.</p>
<h2>what can we compute?</h2>
<p>the shared meaning of the model of church-turing computation quite misinteprets what we can compute. it only claims that a turing machine can compute anything a perfect mathematician with infinite time and tape can. it does not claim an upper bound on what it is possible for the mathematician to think of.</p>
<p>the mathematician may fall asleep in eternity. dream of the notes of water droplets and how they never seem to stop falling. and when the mathematician wakes up, they just know ( in O(1) ), that the solution/algorithm they were approaching has no end. it is at that point that they know, that there is no end.</p>
<p>this model of computation is called hypercomputation.</p>
<h2>what should we compute?</h2>
<p>at this point, it should be quite clear that computers can think. ( if we are to synonymize the meaning of computation to collective thought ).</p>
