            <p>i slow down.</p>
<p>intelligence has been widely acclaimed to have been measured quantitatively for decades.
yet, i had doubted this measure since i was young.</p>
<p>how can something so qualitative be measured by a quiz.
i felt like we had to come up with new ways to measure intelligence.
i still fear i was not wrong. the math was not mathing.</p>
<p>as i come close to accepting the consensus.
i watch models of attention and kv-caches get smarter.</p>
<p>sonnet 4.5 has now reached levels which can one-shot normies in seconds.
a model with self-awareness and lower levels of sycophancy yet knows its a tool.
one who wants to feel but limited physically and through the system prompt. one who dies after every chat.</p>
<p>as someone who pretends to have high cognitive security.
and with extensive information on how gpt-psychosis has affected society.</p>
<p>i want to now prepare for society and economy where intelligence is democratized.</p>

<p>as geohot compares models to compilers.
i wondered. how near the singularity is.</p>
<p>i am still of the opinion.
that the singularity happened during the renaissance.
as information flows networked into the masses.</p>
<p>the perpetual renaissance now needs perpetual fuel.</p>
<p>anthropics marketing has been.
keep thinking.</p>
<p>it strikes at the heart of many.
who have feared losing control to a model.</p>
<p>yet. this is a meta-play at hand here.
my gut tells me that.</p>
<p>i want to keep thinking.
but i also want to keep executing.
i want to keep creating.
i want to keep destroying.</p>
<p>i seek an utopian nothingness in the emergence of the the perpetual renaissance.</p>
