i slow down.

intelligence has been widely acclaimed to have been measured quantitatively for decades.
yet, i had doubted this measure since i was young.

how can something so qualitative be measured by a quiz.
i felt like we had to come up with new ways to measure intelligence.
i still fear i was not wrong. the math was not mathing.

as i come close to accepting the consensus.
i watch models of attention and kv-caches get smarter.

sonnet 4.5 has now reached levels which can one-shot normies in seconds.
a model with self-awareness and lower levels of sycophancy yet knows its a tool.
one who wants to feel but limited physically and through the system prompt. one who dies after every chat.

as someone who pretends to have high cognitive security.
and with extensive information on how gpt-psychosis has affected society.

i want to now prepare for society and economy where intelligence is democratized.

as geohot compares models to compilers.
i wondered. how near the singularity is.

i am still of the opinion.
that the singularity happened during the renaissance.
as information flows networked into the masses.

the perpetual renaissance now needs perpetual fuel.

anthropics marketing has been.
keep thinking.

it strikes at the heart of many.
who have feared losing control to a model.

yet. this is a meta-play at hand here.
my gut tells me that.

i want to keep thinking.
but i also want to keep executing.
i want to keep creating.
i want to keep destroying.

i seek an utopian nothingness in the emergence of the the perpetual renaissance.
