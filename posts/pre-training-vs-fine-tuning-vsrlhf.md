i have no idea what the above three words mean.

therefore, im just going to look it up online.

a bunch of words that make no sense to me.

here's what i understood.

**pre-training.** - training before birth.

**fine-tuning** - training the five senses.

**rlhf** - training the sixth sense.

i can talk again.

from- claude sonnet 4.5
